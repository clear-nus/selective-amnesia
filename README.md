  <span>Figure 1: Qualitative results of our method, Selective Amnesia (SA). SA can be applied to a variety
of models, from forgetting textual prompts such as specific celebrities or nudity in text-to-image
models to discrete classes in VAEs and diffusion models (DDPM).</span>

This is the official code repository for the NeurIPS 2023 Spotlight paper [Selective Amnesia: A Continual Learning Approach for Forgetting in Deep Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10120).

The code is split into three subfolders, one each for VAE, DDPM and Stable Diffusion experiments. Detailed instructions are included in the respective subfolders.
